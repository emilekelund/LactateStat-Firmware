# LactateStat Firmware repository

This is the Firmware used in my master thesis: Development of Electronics for a Wearable Sensor that Detects Lactate in Sweat.

The firmware was written in Segger Embedded Studio for the Arm Cortex-M4 based nRF52832 from Nordic Semiconductor. Custom made library for the LMP91000 AFE from Texas Instruments. BLE service implemented. The firmware is based on SDK15.
